Welcome to the My-FLix client source code. Thanks for checking it out

Just a couple of things to bear in mind when running the code:

//Debugging the build issues
The code needs to be compiled using Parcle (Dont use parcel Bundler),
If the code is having a build issue, try this (Delete the (Parcel.cache and dist folders) then rerun the parcel its solved all my issues,
Be sure to use parcel src/index.html when building

Please use the WIP branch for debugging and code checking

//Using the app
Be sure to log in to the app as the rest of the app will not work as intended,
If you don't have a login please register or use the testing account (Username: Kirk, Password: databaseadmin).

Finally another thank you for checking out my first react project

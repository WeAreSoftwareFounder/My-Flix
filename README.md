Welcome to the My-FLix client source code. Thanks for checking it out

Just a couple of things to bear in mind when running the code:

//Debugging the build issues
The code needs to be compiled using parcle (Dont use parcel Bundler),
If the code is having build issue, try this (Delete the (Parcle.cache and dist folders) then rerun parcel its solved all my issues,
Be sure to use parcel src/index.html when building

//Using the app
Be sure to login to the app as the rest of the app will not work as intended,
If you dont have a login please register or use the testing account (Username: Kirk, Password: databaseadmin).

Finally another thanmk you for checking out my fist react project
